   It is a gaming project where the intelligence of computer is given by some programming logic to play vs human opponent. There are 24 boxes with 18 different colours where 9 for each player and the boxes are connected vertically, horizontally and diagonally. In bangla the game is known as নয় গুটি where one can get the box of opponent out by making three same colours boxes of own colour. The computer is also programmed with similar logic to play against the opponent. So play the game and have fun.
